It's now worth a little over $13000 USD. </p> <p>I've watched videos and read articles and understand blockchain as a concept, but I'm still struggling to understand what the monetary value actually is. I feel like all my efforts have been unsuccessful. </p> <p>I just graduated college and will start work in about a month. In a crazy world, I can max out my retirement for the year (401k and roth IRA) in just five months but will likely need some extra funds to make ends meet. Part of me is considering liquidating my bitcoin to do this, because I just can't make sense of crypto in my head. Any thoughts? I could pull it all out at once, or take it as I need it, or not at all</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bitz-the-ninjapig\"> /u/bitz-the-ninjapig </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1lrzauc/is_it_worth_owning_crypto_if_i_dont_fully/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1lrzauc/is_it_worth_owning_crypto_if_i_dont_fully/\">[comments]</a></span>",
