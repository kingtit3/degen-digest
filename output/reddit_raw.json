I dont know anything about crypto but from what I can gather, she converted her money into &quot;USDC&quot; and then bought &quot;ETH&quot; and was &quot;mining&quot;, withdrawing a bit of money every 6 hours.</p> <p>Yesterday, the app showed a transaction of the total amount in the account to &quot;ETH-Defi&quot; from which she cannot remove her funds. It is giving her some sort of 6 day countdown and it seems to be its own account in the app in which she can move the funds from ETH to UDSC within it but cannot withdraw out of this account to her original <a href=\"http://crypto.com\">crypto.com</a> wallet. Every time she exchanges between the coins, a fee is collected.</p> <p>She says she has not shared her 12-word phrase with anyone; however, her account address or hash or something was shared with someone she now knows to be a scammer. Is it possible that this person took funds out of an account using just the account address? Is this a separate scam? Or did she just click something and just doesnt understand the platform well enough to withdraw?</p> <p>I've been trying to read up on crypto stuff but I have zero experience with it and honestly cannot wrap my head around the whole thing, however I know that scams run absolutely rampant in the crypto world. I thought onchain and <a href=\"http://crypto.com\">crypto.com</a> were legit though... does anyone know anything that will be able to help her? Do we just call it a day and accept the money is lost?</p> <p>edit, these are her words:</p> <p>I opened a crypto account and connected it to the onchain app. On the onchain, i signed up for a contract for mining on the app. They asked to connect the contract to the onchain wallet and hold the funds in custody while mining. Every six hours, they generate a profit in Ethereum which has to be exchanged back to USDC and can be withdrawn back into the wallet. After some profits were accumulated and I was withdrawing $100 every 6 hours, suddenly all the funds were sucked into the contract. I am unable to withdraw back into the wallet, but I can change the funds from USDC to ETH and ETH to USDC, but every time I do so, a fee is collected. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lost_Actuary_5359\"> /u/Lost_Actuary_5359 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1lnjf0j/did_my_mom_get_scammed/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1lnjf0j/did_my_mom_get_scammed/\">[comments]</a></span>"
