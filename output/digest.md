⸻

🧠 **Daily Degen Digest Script Template**

⏱ **Target Length:** ~60–90 seconds
📆 **Use:** Reusable daily for your crypto Solana video content

⸻

🎬 **Prompt Template (for AI or manual scripting):**

**Prompt:**
Write a 60–90 second script for a short-form video episode of "Daily Degen Digest", a fast-paced Solana-focused series.

The tone should be casual, sharp, and crypto-native — filled with memes, slang, and sarcasm, like a Twitter degen giving the daily rundown.

Include the following sections:

⸻

**1. Cold Open / Hook (1–2 lines):**
Grab attention fast with something wild, funny, or stats-based.

**2. Top 3 Memecoin Movers (3–4 sentences):**
For each coin, give the name, % change, market cap, and vibe.
Optional: Mention a tweet, community reaction, or rug warning.
Example format:

*"$PEEPORUG did a 45x from 3k to 140k before dumping harder than SBF's PR team. Classic."*

**3. Launch Radar (1–2 new tokens):**
Mention new launches from Pump.fun or LetsBonk.fun.
Call out launch speed, wallet count, or any signs of going viral.

**4. Solana Ecosystem Update (1 highlight):**
Cover any dev news, dapp/tool releases, partnerships, or weird events.
Keep it snappy — you're talking to degens, not VCs.

**5. Outro Call-to-Action:**
Sign off in-character with a strong closer.

*"That's your hit of hopium for today — like, follow, and stay wrecked."*
